<h2>Biography</h2>
<div id="biography">
<p>
    With an authoritative voice and calm demeanor, this ever popular 
    American actor has grown into one of the most respected figures 
    in modern US cinema. Morgan was born on <em>June 1, 1937</em>  in Memphis, 
    Tennessee, to Mayme Edna (Revere), a teacher, and Morgan Porter
    field Freeman, a barber. The young Freeman attended <strong>Los 
    Angeles City College</strong> before serving several years in the 
    US Air Force as a mechanic between 1955 and 1959. His first dramatic 
    arts exposure was on the stage including appearing in an all-African 
    American production of the exuberant musical Hello, Dolly!.

<p>
Freeman first appeared on TV screens as several characters including 
"Easy Reader", "Mel Mounds" and "Count Dracula" on the Children's Tel
evision Workshop (now Sesame Workshop) show The Electric Company (1971). 
He then moved into feature film with another children's adventure, Who 
Says I Can't Ride a Rainbow! (1971). Next, there was a small role in the 
thriller Blade (1973); then he played Casca in Julius Caesar (1979) and 
the title role in Coriolanus (1979). Regular work was coming in for the 
talented Freeman and he appeared in the prison dramas Attica (1980) and 
Brubaker (1980), Eyewitness (1981), and portrayed the final 24 hours of 
slain Malcolm X in Death of a Prophet (1981). For most of the 1980s, Fr
eeman continued to contribute decent enough performances in films that 
fluctuated in their quality. However, he really stood out, scoring an O
scar nomination as a merciless hoodlum in Street Smart (1987) and, then, 
he dazzled audiences and pulled a second Oscar nomination in the film ve
rsion of Driving Miss Daisy (1989) opposite Jessica Tandy. The same year, 
Freeman teamed up with youthful Matthew Broderick and fiery Denzel Washing
ton in the epic Civil War drama Glory (1989) about freed slaves being recr
uited to form the first all-African American fighting brigade.
